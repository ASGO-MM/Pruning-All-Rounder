### The PAR implementations for LLaVA-1.5. 
### Tips are as follows (and will be further detailed soon):
#### Model Structures can be found in llava/model/multimodal_selector.
#### Inference Modifications also involves llava/model/language_model, particularly (1) llava_llama.py and (2) llama.py.
#### We largely follow the original LLaVA implementations and structures to facilitate the 'plug-and-play' adaptations.
